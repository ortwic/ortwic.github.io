### Allow to introduce myself
# I’m a Fullstack Developer Based in Bavaria, Germany


My focus are web applications where I started small with so called DHTML and JavaScript in 2006. Check out my legacy projects to learn more.

Over the years I gained a deep knowledge in C# and .NET where Linq and Regex became beloved tools of mine. Anyways, technologies doesn’t matter that much as knowledge of good software design and design patterns. Applying Clean Code principles, steady refactoring and refining business logic are essential steps to serious software development. As well a high test covarage ensures reliability, maintainability, extendability and not least good performance.
